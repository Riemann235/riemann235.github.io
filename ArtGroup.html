                        Support from the ADT has enabled our small group of amateur artists to cover the costs of hall hire, purchase studio easels,
                        put on exhibitions of the group's work and cover petrol costs for visits to professional art events.

                        Braco Art Group meets every Wednesday afternoon for 2 hrs of informal and very sociable painting.
                        The group is a 60-40 mix of experienced artists and relative beginners.
                        Everyone is free to follow their own interests including oils, acrylics, watercolour and pastels.
                        The group helps each other, with the more experienced members offering help, encouragement and support to
                        anyone who wants it. We also go on art related visits and this year are visiting the Van Gogh Experience in Edinburgh
                        and in the past have visited the Pittenweem Exhibitions. We are hoping to invite ‘professional’ artists
                        from time to time to offer guidance and provide ideas on how to develop our own work.
                        Every 2 years we have a one day exhibition of work in the Village Hall,
                        often in conjunction with other groups from the village such as Pins and Needles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New members are always very welcome regardless of their level of experience or ability.
                        Beginners who would like to give art a try are particularly welcome.
                        Basic art materials can be provided for beginners, meaning they do not have to commit to buying materials whilst
                        they decide if this is a hobby they wish to pursue.
