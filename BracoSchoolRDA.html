                    <p>
                        Some of our learners at Braco school have been enjoying Rideaway lessons through
                        RDA (Riding for the Disabled Association).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The children who attend have a range of Additional Support Needs.
                        The lessons for some are to strengthen core muscles, for some to build resilience
                        and self-esteem and for some to help with self-regulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our learners who attend are all highly motivated to take on the challenge.
                        On a Wednesday morning our riders gather together and are driven by either parents
                        or a staff member to Crieff Hydro Riding Centre.
                        They are dressed in appropriate safety gear and matched with their pony.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I attended the first session with our riders and attended another a few weeks ago… what a difference!
                        The children are much more confident and at ease with the horses and are developing super relationships
                        with the instructors. I was an extremely proud head teacher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back at school our riders are building on their resilience…if they can ride a horse,
                        they can surly attempt other tasks! Occupational Therapists have commented on the development
                        of Core muscles, our riders are beginning to be more confident and be calmer in challenging situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The benefit of these lessons are starting to show.
                        RDA would be impossible without the support of the ArDoch Development Trust.
                        Thank you
                    </p>
