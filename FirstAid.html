                        The courses were arranged by the Braco and Greenloaning Community Council and funded by the Ardoch Development Trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The suggestion to hold Emergency First Aid courses was originally made by a member of the community
                        and we agreed this would be a good idea and to link this in with Defibrillator training.
                        We initially asked members of the Community if they would be interested if we held some Emergency First Aid courses 
                        and there was approximately 20 people responded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We received quotes from British Red Cross of £572 for 6-12 people for a 1 day course and ABC Training of £350
                        for up to 12 people for a 6 hour course (or 2 x 3 hour evenings).
                        It was agreed by all members of the Community Council to book ABC Training.
                        We then contacted everyone who was interested with their preferred dates and managed to fill two courses.
                        One of which was held in Braco Hall on the evenings of Monday 20th and Tuesday 21st March from 6-9pm 
                        and the other was held on Sunday 26th March from 9.30am – 3.30pm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The courses covered incidents such as chocking, epilepsy, heart attacks and strokes.
                        Participants were shown what to do when someone is unconscious and how to perform CPR
                        and use the defibrillators.
                        23 members of the Community have now received their "Level 2 Emergency First Aid at Work and 
                        the use of an AED" certificates and we would like to thank ADT for making this possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We received some positive feedback from participants, examples of which are below:-

                            "Please could you convey my thanks to Mark Agley for his excellent presentation of the ABC first aid course. His approach in layman's terms made it easier to take on board. Whilst I have attended several courses in the past it was great to learn of the updates and new ways to administer first aid in the years since I have retired.
                            A huge thank you to ADT for funding the courses. I feel it was funding well spent. 
                            Also, extremely beneficial to all who took part and the wider community for when needs for assistance are required".
