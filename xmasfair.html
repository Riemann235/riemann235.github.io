            <h3>Braco Christmas Fair 2017</h3>

            <p>
                On Saturday 11th November 2017, people from far and wide gathered to visit the inaugural Braco Christmas Fair, organised by a few mums who live in the villages of Braco and Greenloaning. The morning of the fair was crisp and cold, so the first port of call for visitors seemed to be the pop-up cafe which served the usual tea and coffee, along with more festive offerings such as mince pies, mulled wine, and hot chocolate with lots of cream and marshmallows!

            <p>
                There were a range of stallholders offering a variety of potential Christmas presents from handcrafted local art, pottery, and crafts, to candles, handmade baby items, and beauty products. Footfall was high, with over 150 people turning up to share in the festive cheer at this free event.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fair was a great success for both ticking off the present list, and making new friends! The event was kindly supported by the Ardoch Development Trust, who gave a grant of £249 to assist with the organisation of the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                In total, proceeds of £369 were collected, all of which will be given to the Braco Toddlers Group.
                We are hoping that this will become a regular event, and thank the local community for all their support!
